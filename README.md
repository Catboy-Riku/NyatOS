# NyatOS
Simple text based OS for computer craft with Musicify integration.

Divided into 2 versions, Public and Secure, with only a couple differences in secure mode.<br />
Secure mode only allows NyatOS admin users to output redstone signal for opening doors or whatever.<br />
It also disallows the Guest user from logging in entirely.<br />

Default user logins are as follows:<br />
<br />
AdminUser: Riku<br />
AdminPass: 1111<br />
<br />
GuestUser: Guest<br />
GuestPass: $pass42<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the logins are case-sensitive.<br />
Also I would highly recommend changing the admin password and username by using the OS after installing.<br />
Simply login using the default admin login, then change what you want from there.
