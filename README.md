# NyatOS
Welcome to the Neko Yap Advanced Text Operating System! Or NyatOS for short.<br />
The official operating system of Nyatopia! (Thats just my colony lol)<br />
A super simple text based OS with its own custom Musicify integration and some other programs for Computer Craft.<br />
For the people who dont like all the kerfuffle of a complicated OS, just paste and go.<br />

Divided into 2 versions, Public and Secure, with only a couple differences in secure mode.<br />
Secure mode only allows NyatOS admin users to output redstone signal for opening doors or whatever.<br />
It also disallows the Guest user from logging in entirely.<br />

Default user logins are as follows:<br />
<br />
*Yo a little help here!?... Alright alright I got it, stand back son.. One, one, one, uhhmmmuhhhhh one!<br />*
<br />
Admin User : Riku<br />
Admin Pass : 1111<br />
<br />
Guest User : Guest<br />
Guest Pass : $pass42<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the logins are case-sensitive.<br />
Also I would highly recommend changing the admin password and username by using the OS after installing.<br />
Simply login using the default admin login, then change what you want from there.

# Installation

Installing it is super easy, just type ONE of the commands below into a fresh computer,<br />
wait for it to ask you to press enter, then it should reboot automatically into NyatOS.
