# NyatOS
Simple text based OS for computer craft ith several programs included.

Divided into 2 version, Public and Secure, with only a couple difference in secure mode.
Secure mode only allows NyatOS admin users to output redstone signal for opening doors or whatever.
It also disallows the Guest user from logging in entirely.

Default user logins are as follows:<br />
<br />
AdminUser: Riku<br />
AdminPass: 1111<br />
<br />
GuestUser: Guest<br />
GuestPass: $pass42<br />
<br />
<br />
I would highly recommend changing the admin password and username by using the OS after installing.
Simply login using the default admin login, then change what you want from there.
